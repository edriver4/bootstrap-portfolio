                            <p class="lead">My name is Bradley and I am currently an employee at athenaHealth. I have a English
                                Golden Retriever and his name is Charlie. Charlie is that white fluff-ball in the picture
                                above. Anyways back to me, I am a huge University of Georgia football fan...which is very
                                ironic since I am technically a student of the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp here
                                at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Talk about an internal conflict! But the reason why
                                I choose to do this program is because I wanted to change my career path towards something
                                where I can benefit and impact the rest of the world. Or you can just say that I love coding
                                and think is very intriguing.</p>

                            <p class="lead">What do I like to do for fun? I really enjoy hanging out with my friends. My
                                friends are my life, so without them I would feel lost. I have a great friend group. I also
                                enjoy working out, I am a bit of a health nut really and enjoy fitness. Another thing that
                                I like to do is play videogames, especially COD and Fortnite. Even though I am completely
                                terrible at Fornite, it is still fun to play with my friends. I also enjoy spending time
                                with my dog Charlie. Some other hobbies of mine are: spending time with my family, fishing,
                                watching sports, going to Church, being outside, and the beach.</p>
